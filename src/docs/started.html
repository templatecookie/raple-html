                                We are using <a href="https://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">gulp</a> which allows having complete automation for
                                build flow. In case if you don't know Gulp then it's easy
                                to use it. Gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in the development workflow, so you can

                                messing around while building any project. You can read it more about it here. Please follow below steps to install
                                and
                                setup all prerequisites:
